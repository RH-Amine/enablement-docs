## Test Driven Development


### Test Driven Development
#### _What Is It?_
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on
the repetition of a very short development cycle.
Requirements are turned into test cases, where the software is developed to pass
the tests.

This practice is particularly powerful when combined with
**Continuous Integration**.


### Test Driven Development
#### _How Does It Help?_
* Creates a detailed specification for the code
* Gives fast feedback
* Indicates whether the last change has broken previously working code
* Allows the design to evolve and adapt as understanding of the problem evolves

## Revenge of the Automated Testing
### Part 1


### Lab Exercise 3: Revenge of the Automated Testing
This lab helps us:
* Understand the "why" behind Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Implement a feature using TDD for the front end and back end of the application
* Write end-to-end tests for a feature and run them through continuous integration


### What new Tools and Frameworks will we use?
* **Jest**: zero configuration testing platform to test JavaScript code
* **Vue Test Utils**: the official testing utility library for Vue.js
* **Nightwatch.js**: easy to use Node.js based end-to-end testing solution for
browser based apps. It uses the powerful W3C WebDriver API to perform commands
and assertions on DOM elements
* **Mocha**: feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in
the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun
* **Sinon**: standalone test spies, stubs, and mocks for JavaScript. Works with
any unit testing framework
