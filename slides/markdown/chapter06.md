## Impact Mapping


### Impact Mapping
#### _What is It?_
Impact Mapping is an engaging, graphical, and strategic planning technique. It
was introduced by Gojko Adzic in 2012.

At the end of the impact map, you should have:
* A shared understanding of your project's goal or problem statement
* An inventory of human behavioral changes (impacts) that must occur (or not occur)
for your project to be successful
* Optionally, an inventory of project scope that could be delivered to achieve
the aforementioned impacts
* Some sort of prioritization of scope and/or impacts

### Impact Mapping
#### _Why Use It?_
* Focuses on business objectives
* Re-orients us towards delivering value, not delivering features
* Introduces a very simple human centered design process
* It is a graphical mind map
  * Reduces the barrier to entry for participants and facilitators
* The technique is highly adaptable for time and audience
* Helps identify which hypotheses are the most valuable to test

   * Goal: Create an easy to use tool to allow users to get tasks done
2. Discuss: Is this a good goal?
3. Discuss: Who are the actors?


### Exercise - Impact Mapping
As a team:
