## Demo Day


### Demo Day
#### _What is Demo Day about?_
* Demo Day is the culmination of a trip around the Practice Loop
* It is an opportunity for the team to showcase their work from a particular
time period
* An opportunity for key stakeholders to see the results
* An opportunity to talk about "what's next" and how do to adapt the culture for
the next round
* An opportunity to celebrate!


### Demo Day
#### _Tips_
* "Show" NOT "tell"
* Take the opportunity to drive excitement around the product **and** culture
* The demo should include not just the product of a sprint or release but of
the **culture** and **philosophy** used to produce it



## The Showcase


### The Showcase
#### _What is It?_
* An event where stakeholders and interested parties are given a demonstration of
recent work performed by a team.
* The latest increment of the product with new features built by the team is
showcased.
* Provides an opportunity to review culture and practices used by the team.
* It is often performed at the end of an iteration but can be performed at key
milestones in the life of the product.


### The Showcase
#### _Why Use It?_
The showcase provides a critical feedback loop for products being incrementally
and iteratively built. Stakeholders can give feedback on the features as they
are being built, suggest improvements, give ideas for new features, and catch
problems early.

Other benefits:
* Provides an open forum for channeling feedback from stakeholders to product
leadership so that prioritization and future work can be adapted accordingly
* Enables collaboration across all interested parties on a regular basis



### Exercise: The Successful Demo Day
In teams, take some time to brainstorm:
* What are all the items/activities you would include in Demo Day? Consider:
  * People, processes **and** technology
* What are the success factors in holding a showcase?
* What patterns of behavior have changed positively?
* What patterns of behavior need to be re-enforced?

### Exercise: Team Approaches to Demo Day
Each team takes turns presenting their ideas of a perfect demo day:
* What activities and in what order would you include in Demo Day?
* What would your showcase look like? (we won't actually demo anything)
* Who would you invite?
