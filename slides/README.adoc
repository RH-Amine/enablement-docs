# DO500 Instructor Slides

### Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that
presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set
up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to
the reveal.js source code.

1. Install http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] (4.0.0 or later)

2. Clone the reveal.js repository
[source, sh]
[user@host path]$ git clone https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO500

3. Navigate to the slides folder
[source, sh]
[user@host path]$ cd slides

4. Install `npm` dependencies:
[source, sh]
[user@host path]$ npm install

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes:
[source, sh]
[user@host path]$ npm start

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation.  You can change the
port by using:
[source, sh]
[user@host path]$ npm start -- --port=8001

### Folder Structure

- **css/** Core styles without which the project does not function
- **js/** Like above but for JavaScript
- **plugin/** Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js
- **lib/** All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)
