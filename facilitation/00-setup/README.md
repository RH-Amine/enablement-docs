# Setting up the Enablement Session

> These notes are intended to evolve into a set of shared thoughts on how to set up and facilitate the Open Innovation Labs DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement.

_____


## Booking the space and facilities

Key requirements for the venue include:

* Desks in workshop format (5 tables of 4-5 people), ideally on wheels and movable (so we can go through the experience of teams configuring the space)
* Power socket banks for each table 
* LOTS of wall space (more than you could think.... we may need to supplement with "portable wall" boards) 
* Projector that supports HDMI
* Ability to play sound from laptop
* Strong WiFi (all delegates will need to be connected throughout the Enablement)
* At least one break out area - ideally a small room near the main room


## Shopping / Bring List

* Print Exercise Booklets - a PDF of all exercises. We have printed these in A4 color, double-sided with wire binding, a clear cover and black card back
* Card printouts of "The Big Picture" components
* Poster printouts of
    * Henrik Kniberg Product Ownership in a Nutshell
    * Henrik Kniberg Skateboard Picture
    * The Agile Manifesto Values and Principles
    * What DevOps is Not
* Some spare adapters for overseas' participants to connect laptops to power    
* Bluetac
* A1 Sticky Chart Paper
* Boards (especially if wall space is lacking)
* Post-it / sticky notes (variety of colors and sizes as described in the Facilitation Guides)
* Sharpies (enough for one per participant + a few extra)
* Whiteboard Pens - mixture of colors
* Magic Whiteboard (especially if there is a lack of whiteboard space in the venue)
* Painters' Tape - mixture of colors
* Bluetooth Speaker
* Fun activities (e.g. a mini golf set and mini ping pong set)
* Option to project build monitors (e.g. through Rasperry Pis) - organise extra monitors or bring projector
* Think about capturing the Enablement by bringing, for example, GoPro Camera, 360 cameera, etc.


## Setting up the Room

The day before the Enablement begins, get access to the room and lay out all materials. Specific things to set up include:
* Backlog
* Burndown
* Definition of Done
* Target Outcomes
* Realtime Retrospective
* Big Picture Area
* Practice Corner Area
* Ping Pong and Golf
* Labs isâ€¦.
* Space for Faces
* Space for Animals

Think about the wall space that will be used for:
* Team's Social Contract
* Wider Group Social Contract
* Event Storming
* Metric Based Process Maps
* Value Slicing
* End of Day Retros


## Facilitation Guidelines

* Facilitation Guides have been prepared for each of the exercises (technical and non-technical). These are intended to be living and breathing documents which will be updated as more Enablement sessions are run.
* Slideware includes lots of real world residency examples of practices being taught. It is expected that these examples will change session-by-session and the Labs facilitators will inject their own stories, photos and videos in here.
