# Impact Mapping

> Session to introduce the practice of Impact Mapping, how we use them and show some examples of real Impact Map artefacts. This will also include facilitating a short exercise to build up an impact map (partially pre-baked) in the context of the exercises we're going to progress to in remaing days of the Enablement session.

## Slides

The latest version of slides for the session are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KezYTSWqSxkyHYPa4SO0lxB8aPrL5T9WPeIzpXmnxRk/edit?usp=sharing)




## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Table groups of 4-6 people
* Sticky notes (6 x 4 size of different colors)
* Sharpie pens
* Wall space to radiate the group impact map
* Monopoly money for voting



## Facilitation Guidelines

* Present the slides to introduce Impact Mapping, what it is, why we use it and walk through the steps in how to use it
* Present the residency examples provided in slides and encourage any Labs people present to talk about their experiences of using the practice
* Kick off the interactive exercise:
    * As a class, put up the pre-baked Goal. 
    * As a class, discuss and add the key actors (for To Do List management, we expect this to be something like "Do-er User", "Fellow Friends/Colleagues")
    * In table groups, capture ideas for impacts / behaviours we might want to achieve in a To Do Management solution.
    * As a class, go round and and capture all the impacts being careful to correct any "outputs" that have been written instead of "outcomes". 
    * We anticipate participants will simply come up with a feature list of ToDoList Apps. We want to steer this into tangible outcomes such as: 
        * Increase my throughput of things I need to do
        * Increase my productivity 
        * Decrease my mental burdon
        * Decrease my wasted time changing between tasks
    * Go on to brain storm a list of deliverables that could help achieve the outcomes. Some pre-baked examples include:
        * Add things to do into a app list
        * Get reminded of upcoming todos via e-mail
        * Get reminded of upcoming todos via SMS
        * Get reminded of upcoming todos via IM
        * Get reminded of upcoming todos via Twitter
        * Share lists
        * Give tasks to others
        * Sync with other devices
        * Set priorities
        * Set due dates
        * Set repeats
        * Create lists within lists
        * Add tags
        * Search tasks
        * Save searches
        * Add location to tasks
        * See tasks nearby current location
        * Integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar
    * Talk about the process of voting to capture the impacts that stakeholders would like to invest in
