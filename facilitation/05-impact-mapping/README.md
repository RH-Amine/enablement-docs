# Impact Mapping

> Session to introduce the practice of Impact Mapping, how we use them and show some examples of real Impact Map artefacts. This will also include facilitating a short exercise to build up an impact map (partially pre-baked) in the context of the exercises we're going to progress to in remaing days of the Enablement session.

## Slides

The latest version of slides for the session are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KezYTSWqSxkyHYPa4SO0lxB8aPrL5T9WPeIzpXmnxRk/edit?usp=sharing)




## Facilitation Materials Needed

* Table groups of 4-6 people
* Sticky notes (6 x 4 size of different colors)
* Sharpie pens
* Wall space to radiate the group impact map
* Sticky dots for dot voting



## Facilitation Guidelines

* Present the slides to introduce Impact Mapping, what it is, why we use it and walk through the steps in how to use it
* Present the residency examples provided in slides and encourage any Labs people present to talk about their experiences of using the practice
* Kick off the interactive exercise:
    * As a class, put up the pre-baked Goal. 
    * As a class, discuss and add the key actors (for To Do List management, we expect this to be something like "Do-er User", "Fellow Friends/Colleagues")
    * In table groups, capture ideas for impacts / behaviours we might want to achieve in a To Do Management solution.
    * As a class, go round and and capture all the impacts (being careful to correct any outputs that have been written instead of outcomes)
    * Talk about the process of dot voting to capture prioritised impacts and facilitate an exercise of doing this
