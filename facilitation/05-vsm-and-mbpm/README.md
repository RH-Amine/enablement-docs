    * In pairs, capture all business processes between the trigger of the business requesting a feature and the outcome of that feature running in production and being used
    * In groups of 12, combine all processes onto a single map
    * Add some metrics based on traditional software development (with minimal automation) - Process Time, Lead TIme, CAC%
    * Facilitate a playback of each MBPM and start discussing about activities or practices that may help drive improvements
