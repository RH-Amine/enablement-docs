## Facilitation Guidelines

* Around 2 weeks before the Enablement session, identify who in the room has been involved in a Labs residency prior to this session (at a minimum, some of the facilitation team should have been).
* Ask if they are interetsed in using 7 minutes to showcase their residency.
* There are no set expecations on presentation - it could be a 7 minute talk, a few slides, a set of photos, a demo of an app / apps, etc. etc.
* During the Enablement session, include each Residency Lightning Talk on the Enablement Backlog.
* We suggest injecting these talks in at various points throughout the 4 day session. Recommended times include:
    * Just before lunch
    * Just before a coffee break
    * When the group need a break away from a lengthy exercise
    * When the content of the Lightning Talk is particularly pertinent to the exerxise or other content being discussed in the wider session
* Time box the talk with a Big Visible Clock
