# Cutting a release of DO500

This document serves to highlight some of the key differences between the two repos currently.
There are minor changes between DO500 (downstream) to the Red Hat Open Innovation Labs Enablement (upstream):
1. Replace images at head of each exercise if needs be (I've accredited them now so should be OK)
2. Replace all https://github.com/rht-labs/enablement-ci-cd with https://github.com/RedHatTraining/rht-labs-ci-cd
3. Remove extension tasks if you must
